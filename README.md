# Contour-extraction-and-colour-filtering.
This project processes natural scene images to detect objects, extract their contours, classify them using pre trained models(YOLOv8 in this case), and save annotations in COCO JSON format. It combines HSV-based color segmentation with contour detection for object recognition.
